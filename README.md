Create a new variable ageGroup that categorizes age into following groups: &lt; 18, 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64 and 65+. • Use sub set of data called “ImpSub” where Impressions > 0 ) in your data set. • Create a new variable called click-through-rate (CTR = click/impression). • Use this ImpSub data set to do further analysis.Analysis of Click Stream Data • For a single day: (Use sub set of data “ImpSub” where Impressions > 0 ) – Plot distributions of number impressions and click-through-rate (CTR = click/impression) for the age groups. – Define a new variable to segment users based on click -through- rate (CTR) behavior. CTR&lt; 0.2, 0.2&lt;=CTR &lt;0.4, 0.4&lt;= CTR&lt;0.6, 0.6&lt;=CTR&lt;0.8, CTR>0.8 – Get the total number of Male, Impressions, Clicks and Signed_In (0=Female, 1=Male) – Get the mean of Age, Impressions, Clicks, CTR and percentage of males and signed_In – Get the means of Impressions, Clicks, CTR and percentage of males and signed_In by AgeGroup.Analysis of Click Stream Data • For a single day: (Use sub set of data “ImpSub” where Impressions > 0 ) – Create a table of CTRGroup vs AgeGroup counts. – Plot distributions of number impressions and click- through-rate (CTR = click/impression) for the age groups – One more plot you think which is important to look at. – Submit your file in to Live session Unit 10 Assignment
